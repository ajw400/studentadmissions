# Student Acceptance Classification with a Neural Network

This project demonstrates how to train a neural network by hand in order to solve a classification problem. In this case, the neural net is trained to predict the admissions decision to UCLA based on several data points.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is recommended to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `studentadmissions/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook StudentAdmissions.ipynb
```
or
```bash
jupyter notebook StudentAdmissions.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
